Abduwali Moallim — Personal Profile Site
This repository hosts my personal profile site, designed as a single-page resume-style portfolio. It showcases my skills, experience, and contact details in a clean, accessible format.
Files & Structure

index.html: The main profile page, built with semantic HTML and optimized for accessibility.
style.css: Custom styles for layout, typography, and responsiveness.

Key Features

Responsive design for all screen sizes.
Structured with semantic HTML (<header>, <main>, <nav>) for better accessibility.
Placeholder-ready for LinkedIn, GitHub, and other profile links.
Optimized for performance with minimal dependencies.

Next Steps & Improvements
Here’s what I’m actively working on or planning to add:

 Replace placeholder certifications with my credentials as I earn them.
 Add a lightweight contact form (e.g., via Formspree or Netlify Forms) with spam protection.
 Enhance SEO with Open Graph/Twitter Card meta tags and JSON-LD structured data.
 Include a professional photo (optimized WebP/JPEG with alt text).
 Test cross-browser compatibility and refine mobile responsiveness.

Deployment
The site is configured for GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml). On push to main, it automatically deploys to:
 Copyhttps://<your-github-username>.github.io/abduwali-profile/
Before Going Live

Update the Formspree endpoint in index.html with a real form ID (or swap for another backend).
Verify the og:url and JSON-LD url fields match the final live URL.
Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (set to deploy from the gh-pages branch).
